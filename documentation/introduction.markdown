## Introduction
### Getting started
Installing a mod in stonehearth is quite easy. You just need to move the desired mod into the specific folder of stonhearth `/stonehearth/mods/`.
Once it was successfully loaded without any error messages by stonehearth you can activate it through the *Mods* Panel within the game. I message will appear *The game needs to reload to apply module changes. Reload now?* By pressing yes you have loaded your first mod :happy: .

The developers of stonehearth also offers a great starting point with some examples regarding modding: [Stonehearth@GitHub](https://github.com/stonehearth). There you can find scripts for animation inside 3ds Max and also a Program for investigating your plugins hierarchy of controllers entities and much more.

In addition to this *Guide/Documentation* the [stonehearth community](https://discourse.stonehearth.net/) is always open for your questions, suggestions and anything else. Another piece of advice is checking out the youtube channel of stonehearth. There you can find lots of interesting topics about modding and so on.

For instance:

### File Extension: .smod

In stonehearth there are two ways of deploying and sharing mods. One way is to create a folder named like the mod. For instance having a mod named *example_mod* will assume that you have a folder inside `/stonehearth/mods/` which is called `example_mod/` -> `/stonehearth/mods/example_mod`.
If your disk does not have enough space or if you just want to save up some space you can use *smod* extensions. They are basically just **renamed *rar* files**. They also get shipped by stonhearth by default. So for that you just need to pack your mod folder into an archive and rename it to `.smod`
